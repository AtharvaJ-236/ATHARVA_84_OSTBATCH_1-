Development Model:
Imagine a group of programmers working together to create a new operating system. They want to encourage collaboration from others, so they choose the BSD development model. 
This means they make their source code open to anyone who wants to see it or contribute to it. It’s like inviting people to help build a house and giving them the blueprint.

Licensing:
Now, let’s talk about the license itself. The BSD license they use is like a set of rules for how people can use their code. It’s quite permissive. It says, “You can use our 
code in your own projects, even for commercial purposes, as long as you follow a few simple rules.” These rules include giving credit to the original developers and not holding 
them legally responsible if anything goes wrong.

Mode of Funding:
The group of programmers behind this operating system needs money to keep things going. They decide to rely on donations and sponsorships from individuals, companies, and 
organizations who appreciate their work. It’s a bit like having a tip jar for their project, and people or businesses can contribute if they like what they see.

Commercial/Non-Commercial Use:
Now, here’s where it gets interesting. Because of the permissive BSD license, both commercial and non-commercial use is allowed. Companies can use this operating system’s code 
in their products, even if they plan to make money from those products. At the same time, non-profit organizations or individual developers can use it for free. It’s like giving 
away your secret recipe for a delicious dish, and both restaurants and home cooks can use it as long as they follow some basic rules.
