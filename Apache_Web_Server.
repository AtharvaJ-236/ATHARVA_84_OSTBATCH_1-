Apache Web Server.
Understanding the developmental model:- Apache HTTP Server is a free and open-source web server that delivers web content through the internet.
It is capable of serving both static and dynamic content and can be configured to handle different protocols, such as HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP. 
Apache is the web server that processes requests and serve web assets and content via HTTP. MySQL is the database that stores all your 
information in an easily queried format. PHP is the programming language that works with apache to help create dynamic web content. It is 
commonly referred to as Apache and after development, it quickly became the most popular HTTP client on the web. Itâ€™s widely thought that 
Apache gets its name from its development history and process of improvement through applied patches and modules but that was corrected back 
in 2000. Features of Apache Web Server:
1. Handling of static files
2. Loadable dynamic modules
